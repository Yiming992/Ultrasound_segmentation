# Ultrasound segmentation
Build a customized model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck using convolutional neural network.
Dataset can be found on [This site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation)
and full analysis can be viewd in the ipynb file, including preprocess of raw image data

## Requirements
```
python 3.5
tensorflow 1.2
CUDA  8.0
cuDNN 5.1
```
